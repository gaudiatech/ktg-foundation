## About
This is the main virtual universe Hosted by Kata.games

It uses both the KataSDK & the [kengi](https://github.com/gaudiatech/kengi) component.
Niobe Polis shall be released via the new [Kata.Games platform](https://kata.games) 
upon completion at some point in 2022.

## Running the prototype (local context)

To run Niobe in local context it requires 3 steps.
**First** using the cmd line, navigate to the `src/precursors` folder and type:
```shell
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
if needed (because `kengi` may not be available everywhere yet),
you can retrieve & install `kengi` directly from
the [kengi repo](https://github.com/gaudiatech/kengi)...

**Second**, copy the whole `src/katagames_sdk-stub` folder
inside `src/precursors/niobepolis` and rename it just
`katagames_sdk`.
**Third** go back to your command line shell and type:
```shell
> python niobepolis
```


## Inspirations
*«Evolution was a random walk across a minefield,
not a pre-ordained trajectory, onward and upward toward perfection»*

**- Greg Egan** (Permutation City)

*«You can look like a gorilla or a dragon or a giant talking penis in the Metaverse»*

*«The sky and the ground are black, like a computer screen that hasn't had
anything drawn into it yet; it is always nighttime in the Metaverse,
and	the	Street is always garish and brilliant,
like Las Vegas freed from constraints of physics and finance»*

**- Neal Stephenson** (Snow Crash)
